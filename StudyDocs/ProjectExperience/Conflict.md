I was working on a project called Robotic Process Automation Library, which is an in-house library. I was putting together a specification for how the library should be organized. There was no clear owner for this task, and so I and the test team lead had differing opinions on how the library should be structured. The test team lead wanted to have source and test directories at the top level, while I wanted to have kind of services libs tools at the top level. Neither strategy is necessarily better than the other, and reasonable people could disagree. I and the test team lead eventually took the decision to a vote and collectively decided as a group. I found the experience to be amazing, as it was very easy to have this kind of conflict with my counterpart. Both I and the test team lead took it very well, and we collaborated as a group very well. I believe that a part of this is the maturity of the folks involved and also the shared interests of the people that we're working together. The challenge is that if you have an engineering organization that doesn't have those things, and doesn't have a clear owner who can kind of be responsible for making decisions when reasonable people could disagree within a particular domain, that that is a recipe for conflict.






**Scenario: Implementing Robotic Process Automation Amid Stakeholder Resistance**

---

**Background:**

In one of my most challenging projects, I led the development and implementation of a **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** initiative across multiple departments in our organization. The goal was to automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency, reduce operational costs, and free up employees to focus on more strategic activities.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Python**: For developing automation bots and creating an in-house automation framework.
- **Angular**: For building a centralized dashboard to monitor and manage bots.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For logging and monitoring bot activities.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automating deployment processes.
- **Integration with Organizational Services**: Connected bots to existing systems and databases.

---

**Conflict with Stakeholders:**

As we began rolling out the RPA solutions, several department heads and stakeholders raised significant concerns:

1. **Job Security Fears:**

   - **Stakeholder Concern**: Employees and managers feared that automation would lead to job redundancies, layoffs, or reduced roles within the company.
   - **Impact**: This led to resistance in providing necessary information for process automation and a lack of cooperation from key personnel.

2. **Process Ownership and Control:**

   - **Stakeholder Concern**: Department heads were worried about losing control over their processes, fearing that automation would centralize operations and diminish their authority.
   - **Impact**: Some departments withheld critical process details or were unresponsive to requests for collaboration.

3. **Data Privacy and Compliance:**

   - **Stakeholder Concern**: There were concerns about how automated bots would handle sensitive data, compliance with regulations like GDPR, and potential security risks.
   - **Impact**: Legal and compliance teams hesitated to approve the deployment of bots, causing project delays.

4. **Change Management Challenges:**

   - **Stakeholder Concern**: Rapid changes in workflows could disrupt existing processes, leading to errors or service disruptions.
   - **Impact**: Reluctance to adopt new workflows and resistance to change from employees accustomed to manual processes.

### **Challenges Faced and Mitigation Strategies**

#### **Challenge 1: Hotspotting in Bigtable Queries**

- **Issue**: Hotspotting occurred when too many read or write requests were directed to a small subset of nodes in Bigtable, leading to performance degradation.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Row Key Design**: Redesigned the row keys to distribute reads and writes more evenly across nodes. Avoided monotonically increasing keys and incorporated hashed components.
  - **Load Balancing**: Implemented load balancing strategies to spread the workload uniformly.
  - **Outcome**: Optimized database performance by 30% and reduced query response time by 50%.

#### **Challenge 2: High API Latency in ETL Pipeline**

- **Issue**: The ETL pipeline experienced high latency due to processing large volumes of data in single batches, affecting the efficiency of the Feature Store ML platform.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Mini-Batching**: Broke down large data batches into smaller mini-batches to process data in parallel, reducing the load on the system.
  - **Concurrency**: Leveraged multithreading in Java and concurrent task execution in Airflow to enhance processing speed.
  - **Resource Optimization**: Tuned system resources to better handle concurrent processes.
  - **Outcome**: Achieved a 40% reduction in API latency and improved overall system efficiency.

#### **Challenge 3: Data Migration from BigQuery to Bigtable**

- **Issue**: Migrating 10 million rows of structured data posed risks of data loss, inconsistency, and prolonged downtime.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Incremental Migration**: Performed data migration in phases, starting with less critical data to validate the process.
  - **Data Validation**: Implemented checksum validations and record counts to ensure data integrity.
  - **On-Demand Service**: Developed a Java-based migration service capable of handling large data volumes efficiently.
  - **Downtime Minimization**: Scheduled migrations during low-traffic periods and optimized the process to reduce downtime to under 2 minutes.
  - **Outcome**: Successfully migrated data with 99.9% integrity and minimal disruption.

#### **Challenge 4: Ensuring Data Consistency During ETL Processes**

- **Issue**: With multiple data sources and transformation steps, maintaining data consistency was challenging.

### Java Basics

#### 1. What is JVM? Why is Java called the Platform Independent Programming Language?
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java bytecode. Java files are converted to bytecode, which the JVM executes. JVMs are platform depended, but the bytecode can run on any JVM or platform, making Java platform-independent.

#### 2. What is the Difference between JDK and JRE?
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Includes the JVM where Java programs are executed and browser plugins for applet execution.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** A comprehensive software development kit for Java, including the JRE, compilers, and tools like JavaDoc and Java Debugger, for developing, compiling, and executing Java applications.

#### 3. What does the “static” keyword mean? Can you override private or static methods in Java?
- **Static Keyword:** Allows access to variables or methods without instantiating a class.
- **Overriding:** Static methods cannot be overridden because they are resolved at compile time, while method overriding occurs at runtime.
- **Method Hiding** If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, then the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass. 

#### 4. Can you access non-static variables in a static context?
No, static variables belong to the class and not to any instance. Accessing non-static variables from a static context causes compile-time error because non-static variables are not associated with any instance yet.

### Wrapper Classes in Java

#### 5. Wrapper Classes in Java
Wrapper classes in Java allow primitive data types (int, char, etc.) to be used as objects.

#### 6. Wrapper Class Creation:
- **Using Constructors:** Every call to a constructor creates a new object. ` Integer obj1 = new Integer(10);`
- **Using Factory Methods:** The `valueOf` method may return a cached object, improves performance. `Integer obj2 = Integer.valueOf(10);`


#### 7. What is Auto-boxing and Unboxing?
- **Auto-boxing:** Automatic conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.
- **Unboxing:** Conversion from wrapper classes to primitive types.

### Casting

#### 8. What is Casting?
Converting a variable from one type to another. It can be implicit or explicit.

#### 9. Implicit Casting/Widening/Up Casting
The automatic conversion of a smaller data type to a larger data type, which is safe and does not result in data loss.
```java
int intVal = 100;
long longVal = intVal; // Implicit casting from int to long
```

#### 10. Explicit Casting/Narrowing/Down Casting
The manual conversion from a larger data type to a smaller one, which can result in data loss.
```java
long longVal = 100L;
int intVal = (int) longVal; // Explicit casting from long to int
```

#### 11. Are all Strings immutable?
Yes, all `String` objects are immutable. Once created, a `String` object’s value cannot be changed; any modification results in a new `String` object.

### String Handling

#### 12. Where are String values stored in memory?
String values are stored in the String Pool within the heap memory. Java checks this pool to reuse existing strings or create new ones.

#### 13. Why should you be careful about the String concatenation (`+`) operator in loops?
Using `+` for String concatenation inefficient as each concatenation creates a new `String` object, leading to multiple temporary objects and high memory overhead.

#### 14. How do you solve the String concatenation problem?
Use `StringBuilder / StringBuffer` for efficient string concatenation. These classes are mutable and designed to avoid creating multiple temporary objects.

#### 15. Differences Between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder

- **String:**
  - **Immutable:** Value cannot be changed once created.
  - **Thread-safe:** Naturally thread-safe due to immutability.
  - **Performance:** Slower for concatenation due to immutability.

- **StringBuffer:**
  - **Mutable:** Value can be changed.
  - **Thread-safe:** Methods are synchronized.
  - **Performance:** Slower than `StringBuilder` due to synchronization but faster than `String` for concatenation.

- **StringBuilder:**
  - **Mutable:** Value can be changed.
  - **Not thread-safe:** Not synchronized.
  - **Performance:** Faster than `StringBuffer` due to lack of synchronization overhead.

#### 16. Examples of Different Utility Methods in the String Class:

| Method                            | Description                                                              | Example                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`length()`**                    | Returns the length of the string.                                         | ```java<br>String str = "Hello";<br>int length = str.length(); // 5<br>```                |
| **`charAt(int index)`**           | Returns the character at the specified index.                             | ```java<br>char ch = str.charAt(1); // 'e'<br>```                                         |
| **`substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)`** | Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.               | ```java<br>String sub = str.substring(1, 4); // "ell"<br>```                              |
| **`indexOf(String str)`**         | Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring.     | ```java<br>int index = str.indexOf("l"); // 2<br>```                                      |
| **`equals(Object anObject)`**     | Compares this string to the specified object.                             | ```java<br>boolean isEqual = str.equals("Hello"); // true<br>```                          |
| **`toLowerCase()`**               | Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.                       | ```java<br>String lower = str.toLowerCase(); // "hello"<br>```                            |
| **`toUpperCase()`**               | Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.                       | ```java<br>String upper = str.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"<br>```                            |
| **`trim()`**                      | Returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.| ```java<br>String trimmed = "  Hello  ".trim(); // "Hello"<br>```                         |
| **`replace(char oldChar, char newChar)`** | Returns a new string with all occurrences of `oldChar` replaced by `newChar`. | ```java<br>String replaced = str.replace('l', 'p'); // "Heppo"<br>```                    |
| **`split(String regex)`**         | Splits the string around matches of the given regular expression.         | ```java<br>String[] parts = str.split("l"); // ["He", "", "o"]<br>```                     |

#### 17. Access Modifiers in Java

| **Access Modifier**       | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                     | **Example**                                                                                 | **Easy to Remember**                                                                              |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Default (Package-Private) Class / Member** | If no access modifier is specified for a class, it is considered to have default or package-private access, meaning it is only accessible within its own package. | class : `class Example { }` member: `class Example { int number; // Accessible within the same package }` | If you don’t specify an access level for a class, it's package-private by default.               |
| **Private**               | The `private` access modifier restricts access to members of the class from any other class. These members are only accessible within the class they are declared in. | ```java public class Example { private int number; // Only accessible within Example class } ``` | Private members are like personal secrets; only the owner knows them.                            |
| **Protected**             | The `protected` access modifier allows access to members from within the same package and also from subclasses, even if they are in different packages.            | ```java public class Example { protected int number; // Accessible within the same package and subclasses } ``` | Protected members are like family secrets; they can be shared with children and relatives.       |
| **Public**                | The `public` access modifier allows access to members from any other class in any package.                                                                         | ```java public class Example { public int number; // Accessible from any class } ``` | Public members are like public news; everyone can access them.                                   |

```

### Final Modifier

#### 19. What is the use of a final modifier on a class?
**Definition:** A class declared as `final` cannot be subclassed. This is used to prevent inheritance.

**Example:**
```java
public final class Example {
    // Cannot be extended
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Final classes are like sealed boxes; you cannot add anything to them.

#### 20. What is the use of a final modifier on a method?
**Definition:** A method declared as `final` cannot be overridden by subclasses.

**Example:**
```java
public class Example {
    public final void display() {
        // Cannot be overridden
    }
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Final methods are like final decisions; they cannot be changed.

#### 21. What is a final variable?
**Definition:** A variable declared as `final` cannot be changed once it is initialized.

**Example:**
```java
public class Example {
    public final int number = 10; // Cannot be reassigned
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Final variables are like constants; their value does not change.

#### 22. What is a final argument?
**Definition:** A method parameter declared as `final` cannot be changed within the method.

**Example:**
```java
public void display(final int number) {
    // number cannot be reassigned
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Final arguments are like fixed rules; they remain the same within their scope.

### Other Modifiers

#### 23. What happens when a variable is marked as volatile?
**Definition:** A `volatile` variable is a special modifier used in multi-threaded programming. It indicates that the value of the variable can change unexpectedly and ensures that every thread reads the value of the variable directly from the main memory, rather than from a thread-local cache. Works on primitive and Objects type variable.

**Example:**
```java
public class Example {
    private volatile boolean flag;
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Volatile variables are like live wires; they can change state at any time.

#### 24. Guess the output
**Question:** What will be the output of the following code?
```java
public class GuessOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 1;
        int y = 1;
        if (x++ > 0 && y++ > 0) {
            x = 10;
        }
        System.out.println("x = " + x + " y = " + y);
    }
}
```
**Answer:** The output will be:
```
x = 10 y = 2
```

**Explanation:** The condition `x++ > 0` evaluates to true (1 > 0), so `x` is incremented to 2. The condition `y++ > 0` also evaluates to true (1 > 0), so `y` is incremented to 2. Since both conditions are true, `x` is set to 10.

#### 25. Guess the output of this switch block
**Question:** What will be the output of the following code?
```java
public class GuessOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;
        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Monday");
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Tuesday");
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Wednesday");
            case 4:
                System.out.println("Thursday");
            default:
                System.out.println("Friday");
        }
    }
}
```
**Answer:** The output will be:
```
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
```

**Explanation:** The `switch` statement starts executing from `case 3`, printing "Wednesday". Since there are no `break` statements, it continues executing the subsequent cases, printing "Thursday" and "Friday".

#### 26. Guess the output of this switch block?
**Question:** What will be the output of the following code?
```java
public class GuessOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 5;
        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Monday");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Tuesday");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Wednesday");
                break;
            case 4:
                System.out.println("Thursday");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Friday");
        }
    }
}
```
**Answer:** The output will be:
```
Friday
```

**Explanation:** Since `day` is 5, which doesn't match any case, the `default` case is executed, printing "Friday".

#### 27. Should default be the last case in a switch statement?
**Answer:** Yes, the `default` case is typically the last case in a `switch` statement. This **convention** improves code readability and ensures that the `default` case acts as a catch-all for any unhandled values.

#### 28. Can a switch statement be used around a String?
**Answer:** Yes, starting from Java 7, the `switch` statement can be used with `String` values.

**Example:**
```java
public class StringSwitch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String day = "Wednesday";
        switch (day) {
            case "Monday":
                System.out.println("First day of the week");
                break;
            case "Wednesday":
                System.out.println("Midweek");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Another day");
        }
    }
}
```

#### 29. What is an enhanced for loop?
**Answer:** "for-each" 

### Array Operations and Characteristics

#### 30. Default Values in an Array
**Answer:** The default values in an array depend on the type of the array elements:
- **int, byte, short, long:** 0
- **float, double:** 0.0
- **char:** '\u0000' (null character)
- **boolean:** false
- **Objects:** null

**Easy to Remember:** Numeric types default to 0, booleans to false, chars to '\u0000', and objects to null.

#### 31. Printing the Content of an Array
**Answer:** You can use `Arrays.toString()` to print the content of an array.
**Example:**
```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));
```

#### 32. Comparing Two Arrays
**Answer:** Use `Arrays.equals()` to compare two arrays.
**Example:**
```java
int[] array1 = {1, 2, 3};
int[] array2 = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(Arrays.equals(array1, array2)); // true
```

### Enums and Switch Statements

#### 33. Enum
**Answer:** An enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants.
**Example:**
```java
public enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Enums are for defining constants.

#### 34. Using a Switch Statement Around an Enum
**Answer:** Yes, you can use a switch statement with an enum.
**Example:**
```java
Day day = Day.MONDAY;
switch (day) {
    case MONDAY:
        System.out.println("Start of work week");
        break;
    case FRIDAY:
        System.out.println("End of work week");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Midweek");
        break;
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Enums work in switch statements like any other variable.

### Variable Arguments (Varargs)

#### 35. Variable Arguments (Varargs)
**Answer:** Varargs allow you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a method.
**Example:**
```java
public void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
    for (int num : numbers) {
        System.out.println(num);
    }
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Use `type... variableName` for varargs.

### Assertions

#### 36. Asserts
**Answer:** Asserts are used for debugging/testing purposes to ensure that certain conditions are true during development.
**Example:**
```java
assert x > 0 : "x must be greater than 0";
```

### Garbage Collection

#### 37. Garbage Collection
**Answer:** Garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management by reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer reachable. JVM automatically frees up memory no longer in use.

#### 38. When Garbage Collection Runs
**Answer:** Garbage collection is run by the JVM automatically based on its own algorithms and heuristics, typically when the system is low on memory.

#### 39. Best Practices on Garbage Collection
**Answer:**
- Minimize object creation.
- Nullify references to objects that are no longer needed.
- Be mindful of memory leaks, especially with collections and event listeners.

**Easy to Remember:** Create fewer objects, nullify unneeded references, avoid memory leaks.

### Initialization Blocks

#### 40. Initialization Blocks
**Answer:** Initialization blocks are blocks of code used to initialize instance variables.
**Example:**
```java
{
    // Instance initializer block
}
```

#### 41. Static Initializer
**Answer:** A static initializer is used to initialize static variables.
**Example:**
```java
static {
    // Static initializer block
}
```

#### 42. Instance Initializer Block
**Answer:** An instance initializer block is used to initialize instance variables.
**Example:**
```java
{
    // Instance initializer block
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Instance blocks for instance variable initialization.


### Tokenizing

#### 43. Tokenizing
**Answer:** Tokenizing is the process of breaking a string into parts (tokens) based on delimiters.
**Example:**
```java
String str = "Java is fun";
StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str);
while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {
    System.out.println(st.nextToken());
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Breaking strings into parts using delimiters.

#### 44. Example of Tokenizing
**Answer:**
```java
String str = "Java,is,fun";
String[] tokens = str.split(",");
for (String token : tokens) {
    System.out.println(token);
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Use `split()` to tokenize strings.

### Serialization

#### 45. Serialization
**Answer:** Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
**Example:**
```java
// No explicit example here; see next sections
```

**Easy to Remember:** Converting objects to byte streams.

#### 46. Serializing an Object Using Serializable Interface
**Answer:**
```java
import java.io.*;

class MyObject implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    int value;

    public MyObject(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}

try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("object.ser"))) {
    MyObject obj = new MyObject(42);
    oos.writeObject(obj);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Use `ObjectOutputStream` and `Serializable` interface.

#### 47. De-serializing in Java
**Answer:**
```java
try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("object.ser"))) {
    MyObject obj = (MyObject) ois.readObject();
    System.out.println(obj.value);
} catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Use `ObjectInputStream` to read objects back.

#### 48. Serialize Only Parts of the Object
**Answer:** Use the `transient` keyword to skip fields.
**Example:**
```java
class MyObject implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    transient int tempValue; // Will not be serialized
    int value;
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Use `transient` to exclude fields from serialization.

#### 49. Serialize a Hierarchy of Objects
**Answer:** Ensure all objects in the hierarchy implement `Serializable`.
**Example:**
```java
class Parent implements Serializable {
    // Fields and methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // Fields and methods
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** All classes in the hierarchy must implement `Serializable`.

#### 50. Constructors During De-serialization
**Answer:** No, constructors are not invoked during de-serialization. The object state is restored from the byte stream.

**Easy to Remember:** Constructors are skipped during de-serialization.

#### 51. Static Variables During Serialization
**Answer:** No, static variables are not serialized. Only instance variables are serialized.

**Easy to Remember:** Static variables are not saved in serialization.

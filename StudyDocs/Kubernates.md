### What are the features of Kubernetes?

Kubernetes provides a robust set of features for managing containerized applications at scale:
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:** Manages the deployment of applications, ensuring smooth rollouts and enabling rollbacks if issues occur.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Automatically assigns IP addresses to containers and uses DNS names for easy access. It also balances network traffic across containers.
- **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces and reschedules them, and kills containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Automatically scales applications up or down based on CPU utilization or other metrics.
- **Automated Bin Packing:** Places containers based on resource requirements and constraints, while optimizing the use of available resources.
- **Secret and Configuration Management:** Manages sensitive information like passwords and SSH keys separately from application code.
- **Storage Orchestration:** Automatically mounts the storage system of your choice, like local storage, public cloud providers, etc., to the container.

### How are Kubernetes and Docker related?

Kubernetes and Docker are complementary technologies used together for deploying containerized applications:
- **Docker:** A platform that packages applications into containers with their dependencies, ensuring consistent runtime environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestrates and manages these containers across a cluster of machines. Kubernetes can work with various container runtimes, Docker being one of the most commonly used.

### What is the difference between deploying applications on hosts and containers?

- **Deploying on Hosts:** Applications are installed directly on the host OS, which can lead to issues like dependency conflicts and difficulties in scaling. Different apps share the same OS, increasing the risk of one app affecting others.
- **Deploying on Containers:** Each application runs in its own isolated environment with all dependencies, on top of the host OS kernel. This provides better resource utilization, easy scaling, and consistency across environments.

### What is a headless service?

A headless service in Kubernetes does not have a cluster IP and doesn't load balance requests. Instead, it directly returns the IP addresses of the associated pods. It's useful for stateful applications where you want to reach each pod directly.

### What are the different components of Kubernetes Architecture?

The Kubernetes architecture comprises several key components:
- **Master Node:** Manages the cluster, consisting of:
  - **kube-apiserver:** Manages API requests and acts as the frontend for the control plane.
  - **etcd:** Stores the cluster's state and configuration data.
  - **kube-scheduler:** Schedules pods to nodes based on resource availability.
  - **kube-controller-manager:** Runs controllers, which are loops that handle routine tasks like maintaining the desired state of the system.
- **Worker Nodes:** Run the application containers, consisting of:
  - **kubelet:** Manages the lifecycle of containers on the node.
  - **kube-proxy:** Handles networking and load balancing between pods.
  - **Container Runtime:** Runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

### What is Kube-proxy?

`kube-proxy` is a network proxy that runs on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. It maintains network rules on the nodes, allowing for communication between different pods and services. It also handles routing traffic to the appropriate pods based on service IP addresses.

### What is the role of kube-apiserver and kube-scheduler?

- **kube-apiserver:** The central management entity that exposes the Kubernetes API. It handles all REST requests for managing the cluster, such as deploying applications, managing resources, and scaling services.
- **kube-scheduler:** Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements, policy constraints, and node availability. It ensures efficient use of resources and balances the load across the cluster.

### Can you explain about the Kubernetes controller manager?

The Kubernetes Controller Manager is a daemon that runs controllers, each of which is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster. For example:
- **ReplicationController:** Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running.
- **Node Controller:** Manages node status and health.
- **Endpoints Controller:** Populates the Endpoints object when a service and a pod are matched.

### What do you understand by load balancer in Kubernetes?

In Kubernetes, a load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple pods. Kubernetes supports several types of load balancers:
- **Internal Load Balancer:** Balances traffic within the cluster.
- **External Load Balancer:** Balances traffic from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
Kubernetes can integrate with cloud provider load balancers or use the built-in `kube-proxy` to balance traffic across pods.

### How does Kubernetes handle network communication between containers?

Kubernetes uses a flat network model, where every pod can communicate with every other pod across nodes without NAT (Network Address Translation). Kubernetes manages networking using:
- **CNI (Container Network Interface):** Plugins like Flannel, Calico, or Weave provide networking for pods.
- **kube-proxy:** Manages the routing of traffic between services and pods.

### How does Kubernetes handle the scaling of applications?

Kubernetes handles scaling through Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), which automatically increases or decreases the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics. Additionally, you can manually scale deployments using `kubectl scale` commands.

### What is a Kubernetes Deployment and how does it differ from a ReplicaSet?

- **Deployment:** A higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to pods. Deployments ensure the desired number of replicas are running, support rolling updates, and rollback capabilities.
- **ReplicaSet:** Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. A Deployment uses a ReplicaSet to maintain the desired number of pods.

### Can you explain the concept of rolling updates in Kubernetes?

Rolling updates in Kubernetes allow you to update a deployment gradually with zero downtime. The process involves incrementally replacing old versions of the application with new ones. Kubernetes will launch new pods while terminating the old ones, ensuring continuous availability during the update.

### How does Kubernetes handle network security and access control?

Kubernetes manages network security and access control through several mechanisms:
- **Network Policies:** Define how pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Controls who can access the Kubernetes API and perform operations.
- **Service Accounts:** Provide identity to pods for accessing the Kubernetes API.

### Can you give an example of how Kubernetes can be used to deploy a highly available application?

Kubernetes can deploy a highly available application by:
- **Deploying the application across multiple pods and nodes**, ensuring redundancy.
- **Using a Service to load balance traffic** across the pods.
- **Setting up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** to handle varying loads.
- **Configuring a multi-zone cluster** to distribute the application across different data centers or availability zones for resilience.

### What is a namespace in Kubernetes? Which namespace does any pod take if we don’t specify any namespace?

- **Namespace:** A Kubernetes namespace is a virtual cluster within a physical cluster, allowing you to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams.
- **Default Namespace:** If no namespace is specified, the pod is placed in the `default` namespace.

### How does ingress help in Kubernetes?

Ingress in Kubernetes is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

### Explain different types of services in Kubernetes.

Kubernetes offers several types of services to expose pods:
- **ClusterIP:** The default service type, exposing the service on a cluster-internal IP.
- **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
- **LoadBalancer:** Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
- **ExternalName:** Maps a service to the content of an external DNS name.

### Can you explain the concept of self-healing in Kubernetes and give examples of how it works?

Kubernetes has self-healing capabilities:
- **Auto-Restart:** If a pod crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it.
- **Replacement:** If a node fails, Kubernetes reschedules pods on a healthy node.
- **Replication:** Ensures the desired number of replicas are running, and automatically creates new pods if any go down.

### How does Kubernetes handle storage management for containers?

Kubernetes handles storage management through Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):
- **Persistent Volume (PV):** A piece of storage in the cluster that can be provisioned dynamically or statically.
- **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):** A request for storage by a pod, which can be fulfilled by a PV.
Kubernetes supports different storage backends, including local storage, cloud-based storage (AWS, GCP, Azure), and network-attached storage (NFS).

### How does the NodePort service work?

The `NodePort` service type exposes a Kubernetes service on a static port on each node’s IP address. It makes the service accessible from outside the cluster by using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. The range for NodePort is typically between 30000 and 32767.

### What is a multinode cluster and single-node cluster in Kubernetes?

- **Single-node Cluster:** All the Kubernetes components, including the master and worker processes, run on a single machine. It's suitable for development and testing.
- **Multinode Cluster:** Consists of multiple nodes (machines), where one or more are master nodes and others are worker nodes. It's used for production environments to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

### Difference between create and apply in Kubernetes?

- **kubectl create:** Creates resources defined in a configuration file. If the resource already exists, the command fails.
- **kubectl apply:** Creates or updates resources defined in a configuration file. If the resource

 exists, it updates it to match the desired state defined in the file.

### You have an application deployed on Kubernetes that is experiencing increased traffic. How would you scale the application to handle the increased load?

To scale the application:
1. **Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Set up HPA to automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU or custom metrics.
2. **Manually scale the deployment:** Use `kubectl scale` to increase the number of replicas.
3. **Scale the underlying infrastructure:** If necessary, use cloud provider tools or Kubernetes cluster autoscaler to scale the nodes.

### You have a Kubernetes deployment running a web application and need to perform a rolling update with zero downtime. How would you accomplish this?

To perform a rolling update:
1. **Update the deployment configuration:** Modify the deployment YAML or use `kubectl set image` to update the application image.
2. **Apply the update:** Use `kubectl apply` to apply the changes. Kubernetes will incrementally update the pods, replacing old ones with new ones while maintaining the desired number of replicas.

### A critical pod in your Kubernetes cluster fails. How would you identify the issue and recover the application?

To identify and recover from the failure:
1. **Check pod status:** Use `kubectl get pods` to check the status of the pods and identify the failed one.
2. **Inspect pod logs:** Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to view the logs and identify any errors.
3. **Check events and describe the pod:** Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to see detailed information and events that led to the failure.
4. **Troubleshoot and fix:** Based on the logs and events, troubleshoot the issue (e.g., resource limits, configuration errors) and redeploy the pod.

### What is the difference between config map and secret? (Differentiate the answers with examples)

- **ConfigMap:** Used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs.
  - **Example:** Storing environment variables like `APP_MODE=production` or configuration files.
- **Secret:** Used to store sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, and SSH keys, in an encoded format.
  - **Example:** Storing a database password `DB_PASSWORD=<encoded-value>`.

### If a node is tainted, is there a way to still schedule the pods to that node?

Yes, you can schedule pods to a tainted node by using **tolerations** in the pod specification. Tolerations allow the pod to ignore the taint and be scheduled on the tainted node.

### Can we use many claims out of a persistent volume? Explain?

No, a Persistent Volume (PV) is bound to a single Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) at a time. However, you can unbind a PVC and bind it to another if the PV is not in use and the storage class allows it.

### What kind of object do you create when your dashboard-like application queries the Kubernetes API to get some data?

When a dashboard queries the Kubernetes API, you typically create a **ServiceAccount** object with the necessary permissions (using RBAC) to authenticate and authorize the dashboard to access the API.

### What is the difference between a Pod and a Job? (Differentiate the answers with examples)

- **Pod:** A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, typically used to run a single instance of an application.
  - **Example:** Running a web server like Nginx in a pod.
- **Job:** A Job creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. It's used for batch or parallel tasks.
  - **Example:** Running a data processing script that completes after processing all records.

### How does Kubernetes handle service discovery and load balancing?

Kubernetes handles service discovery and load balancing through **Services**:
- **Service Discovery:** Uses DNS to allow pods to discover services by name.
- **Load Balancing:** Services distribute traffic across pods using `kube-proxy`. External load balancers can be used for traffic from outside the cluster.

### Explain the difference between a deployment and a statefulset in Kubernetes.

- **Deployment:** Manages stateless applications and ensures the desired number of pod replicas are running. Pods are interchangeable.
  - **Example:** Deploying a web server where each replica is identical.
- **StatefulSet:** Manages stateful applications, ensuring stable, unique pod identifiers and persistent storage.
  - **Example:** Deploying a database where each instance needs a unique identity and persistent storage.

### How does Kubernetes handle persistent storage for stateful applications?

Kubernetes handles persistent storage for stateful applications through **Persistent Volumes (PVs)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**:
- **PVs:** Are pre-provisioned or dynamically provisioned storage in the cluster.
- **PVCs:** Are requests for storage by pods. When a pod requests storage, Kubernetes matches it with a suitable PV.
- **StatefulSets:** Ensure each pod has its own unique PVC, providing persistent storage even if the pod is rescheduled.

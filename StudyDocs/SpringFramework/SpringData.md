## Spring JDBC and Database Specific
### What is Spring JDBC? How Is It Different from JDBC?

**Spring JDBC:** 
- A module in the Spring Framework that simplifies database access, reducing boilerplate code by providing templates and helper classes.
  
**Difference from JDBC:**
- **Boilerplate Code:** Spring JDBC reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for exception handling and resource management.
- **Templates:** It provides `JdbcTemplate` and other templates to simplify database operations.
- **Exception Handling:** Converts checked SQL exceptions into unchecked exceptions.

### What is a JdbcTemplate?

**JdbcTemplate:**
- A core class in Spring JDBC that simplifies the process of executing SQL statements, handling connection management, and exception handling.

### What is a RowMapper?

**RowMapper:**
- An interface in Spring JDBC used to map rows of a ResultSet to instances of a class. It helps in converting a row of data from the ResultSet into an object.

### What is JPA?

**JPA (Java Persistence API):**
- A specification for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java. It provides a standardized way to manage relational data in Java applications using entities.

### What is Hibernate?

**Hibernate:**
- A popular ORM framework that implements JPA. It provides tools for mapping Java objects to database tables and managing their persistence.

### How Do You Define an Entity in JPA?

**Entity Definition:**
- Use the `@Entity` annotation on a Java class to define it as a JPA entity. This class typically represents a table in the database.

### What is an Entity Manager?

**Entity Manager:**
- A JPA interface used to interact with the persistence context. It manages the lifecycle of entities, including CRUD operations.

### What is a Persistence Context?

**Persistence Context:**
- The environment in which entity instances are managed by the Entity Manager. It tracks the state of entities and ensures synchronization with the database.

### How Do You Map Relationships in JPA?

**Relationship Mapping:**
- Use annotations like `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, and `@ManyToMany` to map relationships between entities.

### What Are the Different Types of Relationships in JPA?

**Types of Relationships:**
- **One-to-One**
- **One-to-Many**
- **Many-to-One**
- **Many-to-Many**

### How Do You Define One-to-One Mapping in JPA?

**One-to-One Mapping:**
- Use the `@OneToOne` annotation on the related fields in both entities, and specify the `mappedBy` attribute if the relationship is bidirectional.

### How Do You Define One-to-Many Mapping in JPA?

**One-to-Many Mapping:**
- Use the `@OneToMany` annotation on the collection field in the parent entity and `@ManyToOne` on the field in the child entity.

### How Do You Define Many-to-Many Mapping in JPA?

**Many-to-Many Mapping:**
- Use the `@ManyToMany` annotation on the collection fields in both entities, optionally with a `@JoinTable` annotation to define the join table.

### How Do You Define a DataSource in a Spring Context?

**DataSource Definition:**
- Define a `DataSource` bean in the Spring configuration file (XML or Java Config) using the `@Bean` annotation or `<bean>` tag, specifying connection details like URL, username, and password.

### What Is the Use of persistence.xml?

**persistence.xml:**
- A configuration file used in JPA to define persistence units, including data source details, JPA provider, and entity classes.

### How Do You Configure Entity Manager Factory and Transaction Manager?

**Configuration:**
- Define beans for `EntityManagerFactory` and `PlatformTransactionManager` in your Spring configuration to manage transactions and entity managers.

### How Do You Define Transaction Management for Spring-Hibernate Integration?

**Transaction Management:**
- Use Springâ€™s `@Transactional` annotation or XML configuration to manage transactions, ensuring consistent behavior across your Hibernate operations.

## Spring Data Specific

### What is Spring Data?

**Spring Data:**
- A part of the Spring Framework that aims to simplify the development of data access layers by providing consistent and easy-to-use APIs for various data storage technologies, including relational and non-relational databases.

### What is the Need for Spring Data?

**Need for Spring Data:**
- **Simplification:** It reduces the boilerplate code required to interact with databases.
- **Consistency:** Provides a consistent programming model across different data stores.
- **Efficiency:** Offers out-of-the-box solutions for common data access tasks, like CRUD operations, paging, sorting, and more.

### What is Spring Data JPA?

**Spring Data JPA:**
- A specific module of Spring Data that provides a simplified data access layer for JPA-based applications. It builds on top of JPA to provide repository interfaces that reduce the need for custom DAO implementations.

### What is a CrudRepository?

**CrudRepository:**
- An interface in Spring Data that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities. By extending this interface, you can easily create repositories with basic CRUD functionalities without writing any implementation code.

### What is a PagingAndSortingRepository?

**PagingAndSortingRepository:**
- An extension of `CrudRepository` that adds additional methods to retrieve entities using pagination and sorting. It allows you to handle large datasets more efficiently by dividing them into pages and sorting them based on specified criteria.

### What is DAO?

**DAO (Data Access Object):**
- DAO is a design pattern used to separate the data access logic from the business logic of an application. It provides an abstraction over the underlying database interactions, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.

**Key Features:**
- **Abstraction:** DAO abstracts the data source details (e.g., database, file, web service) from the rest of the application.
- **Separation of Concerns:** It promotes separation of concerns by keeping data access code separate from business logic.
- **Reusability:** DAO classes can be reused across multiple parts of the application or even in different projects.

### Differences Between Hibernate and Spring Data JPA

### Explain Repository Pattern

**Repository Pattern:**
- The Repository pattern is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer over the data access logic. It acts as a mediator between the domain and data mapping layers, managing data operations such as retrieving, storing, and updating data in a repository (e.g., a database).

**Key Concepts:**
- **Abstraction:** Like the DAO pattern, the Repository pattern abstracts the data access layer, making the code easier to maintain and test.
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Commonly used in domain-driven design (DDD) to manage aggregate roots and entities.
- **Reusability:** Encourages code reusability by providing a centralized data access layer.

**Example:**
- In Spring Data JPA, repositories like `CrudRepository` and `JpaRepository` follow the Repository pattern, allowing developers to perform CRUD operations without writing detailed database interaction code.

**Benefits:**
- **Testability:** Easier to mock and test the data access logic in isolation.
- **Maintainability:** Separates concerns, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.
- **Consistency:** Promotes consistent access patterns across different parts of the application.

### DAO (Data Access Object) vs Repository Pattern

| **Aspect**                    | **DAO Pattern**                                                                                    | **Repository Pattern**                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstraction Level**          | Lower-level, focused on data access.                                                              | Higher-level, focused on domain logic.                                                                 |
| **Use Case**                   | Fine-grained control over SQL and database operations.                                            | Business-oriented operations and domain-driven design.                                                 |
| **Implementation**             | Typically a class with CRUD methods and database queries.                                         | Often an interface with data access managed by a framework (e.g., Spring Data JPA).                    |
| **Integration**                | Used in applications where the data access layer needs to be customized.                         | Used in modern frameworks that abstract away the persistence layer, like Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.|
| **Flexibility**                | More flexible in terms of SQL customization.                                                      | More abstract, with less control over the actual database queries.                                     |

In practice, **DAO** is more manual and explicit, whereas **Repository** is more automated and aligned with modern frameworks like Spring Data JPA. The choice between them often depends on the architecture of the application and the level of abstraction desired.

## Hibernate Specific

### Important Interfaces of the Hibernate Framework:
1. **Session**: The main interface between the Java application and Hibernate, responsible for CRUD operations, querying, and transaction management.
2. **SessionFactory**: A factory for `Session` objects, it's a heavyweight object that should be created once per application and shared among threads.
3. **Transaction**: Handles transaction boundaries in a unit of work, ensuring ACID properties.
4. **Query**: Represents a Hibernate query or HQL query for fetching data from the database.
5. **Criteria**: Used for creating dynamic queries in an object-oriented manner.
6. **Configuration**: Configures Hibernate and builds the `SessionFactory`.

### Hibernate Inheritance Mapping:
Hibernate provides multiple strategies to map an inheritance hierarchy of classes to database tables:
1. **Single Table Strategy**: Maps all classes in the hierarchy to a single table. The table contains a discriminator column to differentiate between entities.
2. **Table per Class Strategy**: Each class in the hierarchy is mapped to its own table. Subclasses' tables contain the columns of the parent class.
3. **Joined Strategy**: A table is created for each class in the hierarchy, with the child class' table having a foreign key reference to the parent class' table.

### HQL (Hibernate Query Language):
**HQL** is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL but works with Hibernate entities rather than database tables.

### Creating HQL Queries:
```java
String hql = "FROM Employee WHERE salary > :salary";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
query.setParameter("salary", 10000);
List<Employee> results = query.list();
```

### Adding Criteria to a SQL Query:
Criteria API allows creating complex queries programmatically:
```java
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Employee.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.gt("salary", 10000));
List<Employee> results = criteria.list();
```

### Session in Hibernate:
**Session** is a single-threaded, short-lived object that represents a conversation between the application and the database. It wraps a JDBC connection and is used to create, read, update, and delete operations on persistent objects.

### SessionFactory:
**SessionFactory** is a heavyweight object responsible for creating `Session` objects. It is created once per application and is thread-safe.

### "Session being a thread-safe object":
This statement is incorrect. `Session` is not thread-safe and should not be shared between threads. Instead, a `Session` should be used by a single thread at a time.

### First-level Cache vs. Second-level Cache:
1. **First-level Cache**: This is the default cache in Hibernate and is associated with the `Session` object. It is available only for the duration of the session.
2. **Second-level Cache**: It is an optional cache associated with the `SessionFactory` object and can be shared across sessions. This cache can store objects across sessions and even transactions.

### States of the Object in Hibernate:
1. **Transient**: An object is in a transient state if it is just created and not associated with a Hibernate session.
2. **Persistent**: An object becomes persistent when it is associated with a session and has a corresponding record in the database.
3. **Detached**: An object becomes detached when the session is closed, but the object still exists in the memory.
4. **Removed**: The object is marked for deletion but not yet deleted from the database.

### Making an Immutable Class in Hibernate:
Use the `@Immutable` annotation on an entity class to make it immutable:
```java
@Entity
@Immutable
public class Employee {
    // fields, getters, and setters
}
```

### Automatic Dirty Checking in Hibernate:
Hibernate automatically detects changes made to the persistent entities in a session and updates the database during the transaction commit without needing to explicitly save the entity again.

### Hibernate Architecture:
Hibernate architecture consists of the following:
- **SessionFactory**: Configuration and startup.
- **Session**: Interaction with the database.
- **Transaction**: Managing transactions.
- **Connection Provider**: Abstraction over JDBC connections.
- **Cache**: First-level and second-level caching.
- **Mapping Metadata**: Mapping between Java classes and database tables.

### Criteria API in Hibernate:
The Criteria API is a programmatic way to create queries dynamically. It is object-oriented and allows filtering and fetching entities based on certain conditions.

### session.lock() Method:
The `session.lock()` method is used to reattach a detached object to the session, using a specific lock mode without triggering any database updates.

### Hibernate Caching:
Hibernate provides a caching mechanism to improve performance by storing entities, collections, and queries. There are two levels of caching: first-level (Session) and second-level (SessionFactory).

### merge() Method:
The `merge()` method is used to update an entity's state in the session with another detached entity's state. This method is useful when you have an entity in a detached state and want to synchronize it with the database.

### Query Cache:
The query cache is an optional feature that caches the results of a query for future reference. It is typically used in conjunction with the second-level cache to improve performance.

### N+1 SELECT Problem:
The N+1 SELECT problem occurs when one query is executed to retrieve a list of entities (N entities), and then for each entity, an additional query is executed to retrieve associated data. This can be solved using `fetch` joins in HQL or using batch fetching strategies.

### Single Table Strategy:
The Single Table strategy is an inheritance mapping strategy in Hibernate where all the classes in an inheritance hierarchy are mapped to a single table. A discriminator column is used to differentiate between entity types.

### Benefits of NamedQuery:
- **Reusability**: Named queries can be defined once and reused across the application.
- **Maintainability**: The queries are maintained separately from the business logic.
- **Performance**: Named queries are precompiled at startup, improving performance.

### @DynamicUpdate Annotation:
The `@DynamicUpdate` annotation ensures that only the changed columns are included in the SQL `UPDATE` statement, rather than updating all columns, improving performance.

### Lazy Loading in Hibernate:
Lazy loading is a performance optimization strategy in Hibernate where related entities are not loaded until they are accessed for the first time. This helps in reducing the initial load time and memory usage by only loading the necessary data.

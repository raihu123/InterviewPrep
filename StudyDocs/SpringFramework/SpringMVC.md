![model 1](https://static.javatpoint.com/images/st/model1.jpg)

**Answer:** In Model 1 architecture, the client interacts directly with the JSP pages, which handle both the presentation and business logic. This approach is simple but can lead to poor separation of concerns.

**Easy to Remember:** JSP does everything.

### 2. Model 2 Architecture
**Answer:** Model 2, also known as MVC (Model-View-Controller), separates the application into three components: Model (business logic), View (presentation), and Controller (handles user input). It provides a clear separation of concerns.

**Easy to Remember:** Separate logic, view, and control.

### 3. Model 2 Front Controller Architecture
**Answer:** In Model 2 Front Controller architecture, a single controller (the Front Controller) handles all incoming requests and directs them to the appropriate handlers (controllers).

**Easy to Remember:** One controller for all requests.

### 4. Example Controller Method in Spring MVC
**Answer:**
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {
    @RequestMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello";
    }
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Annotate with `@Controller` and use `@RequestMapping`.

### 5. Simple Flow in Spring MVC
**Answer:**
1. **Client Request:** User sends a request.
2. **DispatcherServlet:** Intercepts the request.
3. **Controller:** Processes the request.
4. **Model:** Populates data.
5. **View:** Renders the response using the model data.

**Easy to Remember:** Request -> DispatcherServlet -> Controller -> Model -> View.

### 6. ViewResolver
**Answer:** A ViewResolver resolves view names to actual view pages (e.g., JSPs).

**Easy to Remember:** Maps view names to pages.

### 7. Model
**Answer:** The Model is an object that holds data to be displayed in the view.

**Easy to Remember:** Holds data for the view.

### 8. ModelAndView
**Answer:** A ModelAndView object holds both the model data and the view name.

**Easy to Remember:** Combines model and view.

### 9. RequestMapping
**Answer:** `@RequestMapping` is an annotation to map web requests to specific handler methods.

**Easy to Remember:** Maps requests to methods.

### 10. DispatcherServlet
**Answer:** The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring MVC, handling all incoming web requests.

**Easy to Remember:** Main controller for Spring MVC.

### 11. Setting Up DispatcherServlet
**Answer:** 
- **XML Configuration:**
   ```xml
   <servlet>
       <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
       <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
       <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
   </servlet>
   <servlet-mapping>
       <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
       <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
   ```
- **Java Configuration:**
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @EnableWebMvc
   @ComponentScan("com.example")
   public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
   }
   ```

**Easy to Remember:** Configure in XML or Java.

### 12. Form Backing Object
**Answer:** A form backing object is a Java object that holds form data submitted by the user.

**Easy to Remember:** Java object for form data.

### 13. Validation Using Spring MVC
**Answer:** Validation is done using `@Valid` annotation and a `BindingResult` object to hold validation results.

**Easy to Remember:** Use `@Valid` and `BindingResult`.

### 14. BindingResult
**Answer:** The BindingResult object holds the results of the validation and binding errors.

**Easy to Remember:** Holds validation results.

### 15. Mapping Validation Results to View
**Answer:** Use `BindingResult` in the controller method to check for errors and return the appropriate view.

**Easy to Remember:** Check `BindingResult` for errors.

### 16. Spring Form Tags
**Answer:** Spring form tags are used to create forms and bind form fields to model attributes in JSP pages.

**Easy to Remember:** Tags for forms in JSP.

### 17. Path Variable
**Answer:** `@PathVariable` is used to bind URL template variables to method parameters in controllers.

**Easy to Remember:** Binds URL variables to method parameters.

### 18. Model Attribute
**Answer:** `@ModelAttribute` is used to bind a method parameter or return value to a named model attribute and make it available in the view.

**Easy to Remember:** Binds method parameter to model attribute.

### 19. Session Attribute
**Answer:** `@SessionAttribute` is used to bind a session attribute to a method parameter in a controller.

**Easy to Remember:** Binds session attribute to method parameter.

### 20. Init Binder
**Answer:** `@InitBinder` is used to customize the data binding for a controller, typically for converting form data.

**Easy to Remember:** Customizes data binding.

### 21. Setting Default Date Format with Spring
**Answer:**
```java
@InitBinder
public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
    SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
    dateFormat.setLenient(false);
    binder.registerCustomEditor(Date.class, new CustomDateEditor(dateFormat, false));
}
```

**Easy to Remember:** Use `@InitBinder` to set date format.

### 22. Why Spring MVC is Popular
**Answer:** Spring MVC is popular due to its flexibility, ease of integration, robust ecosystem, clear separation of concerns, and extensive community support.

**Easy to Remember:** Flexible, integrative, and community-supported.

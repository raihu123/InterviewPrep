### How Do You Mock Data with Mockito?
To mock data with Mockito, you create mock objects for dependencies using `@Mock` or `Mockito.mock()` and define their behavior using `when()` and `thenReturn()` methods. Here’s an example:

```java
@Mock
private MyService myService;

@Test
public void testMethod() {
    // Mocking a method call
    when(myService.getData()).thenReturn("Mock Data");

    // Use the mocked data in your test
    String result = myService.getData();
    assertEquals("Mock Data", result);
}
```

### What Are the Different Mocking Annotations That You Worked With?
1. **`@Mock`**: Used to create and inject mock objects.
2. **`@InjectMocks`**: Used to inject mock objects into the class being tested.
3. **`@Spy`**: Used to create a partial mock, where some methods are real, and others are mocked.
4. **`@Captor`**: Used to create an `ArgumentCaptor` instance for capturing method arguments.
5. **`@MockBean`**: Used in Spring tests to mock a Spring bean and replace it in the application context.

### What is MockMvc?
**MockMvc** is a class provided by Spring for testing Spring MVC controllers. It allows you to perform HTTP requests and validate the responses in a simulated environment without the need for a running server.

### What is `@WebMvcTest`?
**`@WebMvcTest`** is a specialized test annotation in Spring that focuses solely on testing Spring MVC components. It loads only the web layer, allowing you to test controllers and related components without loading the entire application context.

### What is `@MockBean`?
**`@MockBean`** is an annotation used in Spring tests to create and inject a mock of a Spring bean into the application context. It replaces the real bean with the mock for the duration of the test.

### How Do You Write a Unit Test with MockMVC?
To write a unit test with **MockMvc**, you typically use `@WebMvcTest` along with `@MockBean` to mock service layer dependencies. Here’s an example:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@WebMvcTest(MyController.class)
public class MyControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @MockBean
    private MyService myService;

    @Test
    public void testGetEndpoint() throws Exception {
        when(myService.getData()).thenReturn("Mock Data");

        mockMvc.perform(get("/endpoint"))
               .andExpect(status().isOk())
               .andExpect(content().string("Mock Data"));
    }
}
```

### What is JSONAssert?
**JSONAssert** is a library that allows you to compare JSON data in your tests. It provides a way to assert that two JSON objects are equal, even if the order of elements is different. It’s often used in testing RESTful services where JSON responses need to be validated.

### How Do You Write an Integration Test with Spring Boot?
Integration tests in Spring Boot can be written using `@SpringBootTest`. This annotation loads the full application context, allowing you to test how different components work together. Here’s an example:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class MyIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Test
    public void testRestEndpoint() {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("/api/endpoint", String.class);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertEquals("Expected Response", response.getBody());
    }
}
```

### What is `@SpringBootTest`?
**`@SpringBootTest`** is an annotation that tells Spring Boot to look for a main configuration class (one with `@SpringBootApplication`, for instance) and use that to start a Spring application context. It is used for integration testing, where the full application context is required.

### What is `@LocalServerPort`?
**`@LocalServerPort`** is an annotation used in Spring Boot tests to inject the actual port number of the running server when `webEnvironment` is set to `RANDOM_PORT` or `DEFINED_PORT` in `@SpringBootTest`.

### What is TestRestTemplate?
**TestRestTemplate** is a Spring utility that simplifies testing RESTful services. It is a convenient alternative to `RestTemplate` for integration testing, providing additional functionality for handling basic authentication and maintaining session state across multiple requests.

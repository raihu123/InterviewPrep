### 1. **How does an Angular application work?**
An Angular application is a client-side framework for building web applications. It works by using components and modules to structure the app. When a user interacts with the app, Angular manages the data and updates the view (what the user sees) without needing to reload the entire page. The Angular framework handles user inputs, data changes, and dynamic content by binding data to the UI, managing the flow of the application, and communicating with the backend (server) if necessary.

### 2. **What is TypeScript?**
TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it includes everything JavaScript has and adds additional features like static typing, interfaces, and classes. Angular is written in TypeScript because it helps developers catch errors early through type checking and makes the code more maintainable and scalable.

### 3. **Write a pictorial diagram of Angular architecture.**
Angular's architecture is based on the following core building blocks:

- **Modules**: Containers that organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality.
- **Components**: The main building blocks of UI in Angular, where each component controls a part of the screen.
- **Templates**: Define the view for the component.
- **Services**: Provide data and business logic to the components.
- **Dependency Injection**: A design pattern that Angular uses to inject services into components.

Unfortunately, I can't draw directly here, but imagine a diagram where:
- Modules contain components.
- Components have a template and are connected to services through dependency injection.

### 4. **What is metadata?**
Metadata is used to decorate a class in Angular to define how it should behave. For example, when you create a component, you use the `@Component` decorator to provide metadata like the component's selector, template, and styles.

### 5. **What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?**
- **Constructor**: A special method of the class that is called when an instance of the class is created. It's used to initialize class members.
- **ngOnInit**: A lifecycle hook in Angular that is called after the constructor. It's commonly used to perform initialization tasks after Angular has set up the component (like fetching data).

### 6. **How is Dependency Hierarchy formed?**
In Angular, dependencies (like services) can be provided at different levels in the app: 
- **Root Level**: Services are available throughout the app.
- **Component Level**: Services are specific to a component and its children.
This forms a hierarchy where child components can inherit services from their parent components or the root.

### 7. **What is the purpose of the async pipe?**
The `async` pipe in Angular is used to subscribe to an observable or a promise directly in the template. It automatically handles unsubscribing when the component is destroyed, which helps in avoiding memory leaks.

### 8. **What is the option to choose between inline and external templates?**
- **Inline Templates**: HTML code is directly within the component’s TypeScript file.
- **External Templates**: HTML code is placed in a separate HTML file.
The choice depends on the complexity of the template. Inline is good for simple, short templates, while external is better for more complex HTML.

### 9. **What is the purpose of the ‘ngFor’ directive?**
The `ngFor` directive is used in Angular to loop over a collection (like an array) and render a template for each item in the collection.

### 10. **What is the purpose of the ngIf directive?**
The `ngIf` directive is used to conditionally include or exclude an element from the DOM based on a Boolean expression. If the expression evaluates to true, the element is included; otherwise, it’s not rendered.

### 11. **What happens if you use the script tag inside the template?**
Angular templates do not allow the use of the `<script>` tag as it can lead to security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). If you need to add scripts, you should do so in the HTML file of the document or through Angular's `Renderer2` service for dynamic script loading.

### 12. **What are template statements?**
Template statements are methods or properties defined in your component class that are executed in response to user events like clicks. For example, `(click)="doSomething()"` in a template will call the `doSomething` method in the component class when the element is clicked.

### 13. **How do you categorize data binding types?**
Angular provides several types of data binding:
- **Interpolation**: Binding data from the component to the template using `{{}}`.
- **Property Binding**: Binding data to an element’s property like `[src]`.
- **Event Binding**: Binding an event from the template to the component using `()`.
- **Two-way Binding**: Combines property and event binding using `[(ngModel)]`.

### 14. **What is a parameterized pipe?**
A parameterized pipe in Angular is a pipe that can take arguments to customize its output. For example, `{{ dateValue | date:'shortDate' }}` where `'shortDate'` is the parameter that formats the date.

### 15. **What are custom elements?**
Custom elements are a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way. Angular allows you to create custom elements from Angular components, which can be used in any HTML page.

### 16. **Do I need to bootstrap custom elements?**
No, you don't need to bootstrap custom elements in Angular. Once they are created, they can be added directly to the HTML like standard elements.

### 17. **How do you define typings for custom elements?**
When creating custom elements, you can define typings in TypeScript to describe the attributes and methods your custom element should have, ensuring type safety.

### 18. **Explain how custom elements work internally.**
Custom elements work by using the browser’s native APIs to create custom HTML tags. Angular wraps components into these custom elements, allowing them to function as native HTML elements with encapsulated behavior and styles.

### 19. **How to transfer components to custom elements?**
You can use Angular’s `createCustomElement` function to convert Angular components into custom elements. Once converted, these elements can be used in the same way as any other HTML element.

### 20. **What are the mapping rules between Angular components and custom elements?**
Angular maps component properties to custom element attributes and events to custom element events. This allows the custom element to be interacted with like a normal HTML element while still utilizing Angular’s powerful features.

### 21. **How are observables different from promises?**
- **Promises**: Handle a single asynchronous event at a time. They either resolve or reject.
- **Observables**: Can handle multiple asynchronous events over time. They are more powerful as they can emit multiple values and can be canceled.

### 22. **What is a custom pipe?**
A custom pipe is a user-defined transformation logic that you can create in Angular. It is used to transform data in templates. For example, you might create a custom pipe to format phone numbers.

### 23. **Give an example of a custom pipe.**
```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({name: 'phoneNumber'})
export class PhoneNumberPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    // Format a 10-digit phone number
    return `(${value.substr(0, 3)}) ${value.substr(3, 3)}-${value.substr(6)}`;
  }
}
```
Usage in template: `{{ '1234567890' | phoneNumber }}`

### 24. **What is the difference between pure and impure pipe?**
- **Pure Pipe**: Executes only when the input changes. They are stateless and are the most common type of pipes.
- **Impure Pipe**: Executes every time a change detection runs, even if the input hasn't changed. They can be stateful but are less efficient.

### 25. **What is a bootstrapping module?**
The bootstrapping module in Angular is the root module that Angular uses to start the application. It’s usually the `AppModule`, where you specify the root component that should be rendered.

### 26. **Explain how to use HttpClient with an example.**
`HttpClient` is used to make HTTP requests in Angular. Here's a simple example to fetch data from an API:
```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData() {
    return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  }
}
```

### 27. **What are lifecycle hooks in Angular?**
Lifecycle hooks are methods that Angular calls at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. Some examples include:
- `ngOnInit`: Called once the component is initialized.
- `ngOnDestroy`: Called just before the component is destroyed.
These hooks allow you to execute logic during specific phases of the component's lifecycle.

### 28. **What are templates?**
Templates in Angular define the view for a component. They can include HTML, Angular directives, and binding syntax to display data and handle user interactions.

### 29. **How can you read the full response?**
To read the full HTTP response, including headers, you can use the `observe` option with `HttpClient`:
```typescript
this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data', { observe: 'response' }).subscribe(response => {
 

 console.log(response.headers);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

### 30. **How do you perform Error handling?**
Error handling in Angular can be done using the `catchError` operator in RxJS:
```typescript
import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { throwError } from 'rxjs';

this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .pipe(
    catchError(error => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
      return throwError(error);
    })
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### 31. **What is content projection?**
Content projection is a way to pass content from a parent component into a child component's template. This allows you to create reusable components with customizable content. Angular uses `<ng-content></ng-content>` to project content into the template.

### 32. **What is the difference between PROMISE & OBSERVABLES?**
- **Promises**: Handle a single async event. They are eager, meaning they start executing immediately.
- **Observables**: Handle multiple async events. They are lazy, meaning they only start executing when subscribed to.

### 33. **What do you mean by data binding?**
Data binding in Angular is a technique to link your component's data with the UI. It ensures that changes in the component's data automatically reflect in the UI and vice versa.

### 34. **What do you mean by string interpolation?**
String interpolation is a form of data binding in Angular where you embed expressions within `{{}}` in the template to display dynamic data.

### 35. **What are the differences between Angular decorator and annotation?**
- **Decorators**: In Angular, decorators are used to add metadata to classes, methods, properties, or parameters. Example: `@Component`.
- **Annotations**: Annotations were used in earlier versions of Angular but have been replaced by decorators. Decorators are a more general and flexible approach to metadata.

### 36. **What is an AOT compilation in Angular?**
AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation is a process where Angular compiles the application during the build phase, rather than at runtime. This leads to faster rendering and better performance.

### 37. **What are the advantages of AOT?**
- **Faster Rendering**: Since the code is compiled beforehand.
- **Smaller Angular Framework**: Unused parts of Angular are not included.
- **Detects Errors Earlier**: Errors are caught during the build time, not at runtime.
- **Improved Security**: Templates are compiled before deployment, reducing the risk of injection attacks.

### 38. **What are the three phases of AOT?**
1. **Code Analysis**: Angular checks the code for any errors.
2. **Code Generation**: Angular generates the necessary JavaScript code.
3. **Template Type Checking**: Ensures that the bindings in the templates are type-safe.

### 39. **What are the components in Angular?**
Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. They consist of:
- **Class**: Handles the logic.
- **Template**: Defines the view.
- **Styles**: Define the appearance.
- **Metadata**: Describes how the component should behave.

### 40. **What are dynamic components?**
Dynamic components are components that are created and added to the DOM at runtime, rather than being predefined in the template. Angular provides services like `ComponentFactoryResolver` to create these components dynamically.

### 41. **What is the purpose of the base href tag?**
The `<base href>` tag in the HTML document specifies the base URL for all relative URLs in the application. Angular uses this to resolve relative paths to resources like scripts and styles.

### 42. **What are modules in Angular?**
Modules in Angular are containers for organizing an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They group related components, directives, services, etc., and provide a way to manage dependencies and lazy loading.

### 43. **What is DOM?**
DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of the HTML document as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page.

### 44. **What are services in Angular?**
Services in Angular are used to encapsulate reusable logic that can be shared across different components. They are typically used for tasks like fetching data from an API, performing business logic, or managing state.

### 45. **What is two-way data binding?**
Two-way data binding in Angular allows changes in the component’s data to be automatically reflected in the template, and vice versa. This is often achieved using the `[(ngModel)]` directive.

### 46. **What are pipes in Angular?**
Pipes are a way to transform data in Angular templates. They take an input value, process it, and return a transformed value. Angular provides built-in pipes like `date`, `uppercase`, and `currency`, but you can also create custom pipes.

### 47. **What are observables in Angular?**
Observables are a powerful way to work with asynchronous data streams in Angular. They allow you to handle events, data streams, or other asynchronous operations. Observables can emit multiple values over time and can be canceled.

### 48. **How do you chain pipes?**
You can chain multiple pipes together in Angular templates by passing the output of one pipe as the input to another. For example:
```html
{{ value | date:'shortDate' | uppercase }}
```

### 49. **What does Angular Material mean?**
Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular applications, based on Google’s Material Design principles. It provides reusable and customizable UI components like buttons, forms, and dialogs.

### 50. **What is RxJS?**
RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observables. It provides powerful operators to handle data streams in Angular.

### 51. **What is bootstrapping?**
Bootstrapping in Angular is the process of initializing or starting the application. It involves loading the root module (typically `AppModule`) and rendering the root component (typically `AppComponent`).

### 52. **What do you mean by dependency injection?**
Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern in Angular where dependencies (like services) are provided to components rather than being created within the components. This makes the components more modular, testable, and easier to manage.

### 53. **What is the digest cycle process in Angular?**
The digest cycle is a concept from AngularJS (the older version of Angular) where AngularJS checks for changes in the data and updates the view. This concept is not directly used in Angular (Angular 2+), which uses a more efficient change detection mechanism.

### 54. **What are the distinct types of Angular filters?**
In AngularJS, filters were used to format data in the view. In Angular (Angular 2+), this concept is replaced by pipes.

### 55. **How can one create a service in Angular?**
You can create a service in Angular using the Angular CLI with the command `ng generate service my-service`. This generates a service class that you can use to encapsulate business logic or data-fetching operations.

### 56. **What is an Angular Router?**
The Angular Router is a tool that allows you to navigate between different views or pages in your application. It handles the URL routing, manages the browser’s history, and loads the appropriate components based on the route.

### 57. **What is the purpose of the common module in Angular?**
The `CommonModule` in Angular provides common directives like `ngIf` and `ngFor`, which are used in almost every Angular application. It's automatically imported when you create a new Angular module.

### 58. **What is the scope of Angular?**
The scope of Angular is to provide a complete framework for building modern web applications. It includes tools for managing data, creating components, handling routing, and working with services, all while maintaining a strong emphasis on performance, modularity, and developer productivity.

### 59. **How do you create directives using CLI?**
You can create directives in Angular using the Angular CLI with the command `ng generate directive my-directive`. This generates a directive class that you can use to add custom behavior to elements in your templates.

### 60. **What is a rule in Schematics?**
A rule in Angular Schematics defines a set of transformations that can be applied to a project. It’s used to automate code generation, modification, and other tasks related to Angular development.

### 61. **What is Schematics CLI?**
Schematics CLI is a tool provided by Angular to create, manage, and apply schematics. Schematics are templates or scripts that automate tasks like code generation or project updates.

### 62. **What is HttpClient, and what are its benefits?**
`HttpClient` is Angular’s built-in service for making HTTP requests to a backend server. It provides methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and supports features like observables, interceptors, and error handling.

### 63. **What is multicasting in Angular?**
Multicasting in Angular refers to the ability of an observable to share a single subscription with multiple observers. This is often achieved using operators like `shareReplay` or subjects.

### 64. **What is a directive in Angular?**
A directive in Angular is a class that can modify the behavior or appearance of elements in the DOM. There are three types of directives:
- **Component Directives**: Attach a view to the element.
- **Structural Directives**: Change the structure of the DOM (e.g., `ngIf`, `ngFor`).
- **Attribute Directives**

: Change the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`).

### 65. **What is RxJS, and why is it used?**
RxJS is a library for handling asynchronous data streams in Angular. It is used because it provides powerful operators to work with observables, enabling complex asynchronous data handling with a declarative syntax.

### 66. **Explain Modules in Angular.**
Modules in Angular are used to group related components, directives, services, etc., into a cohesive block of functionality. The root module, typically `AppModule`, is the entry point of the application, while feature modules group related features together and can be lazy-loaded for better performance.

### 67. **What is lazy loading in Angular?**
Lazy loading in Angular is a technique to load feature modules only when they are needed, rather than loading them upfront. This improves the initial load time of the application by splitting the app into smaller bundles that are loaded on demand.

### 68. **What are the data binding concepts in Angular?**
Angular provides four main data binding concepts:
1. **Interpolation**: Binding a component property to the view.
2. **Property Binding**: Binding an element’s property to a component property.
3. **Event Binding**: Binding an element’s event to a component method.
4. **Two-Way Binding**: Binding both the data and the event, so changes in the UI or data update each other.

### 69. **How to create an observable in Angular?**
You can create an observable in Angular using the `Observable` constructor from RxJS:
```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable(observer => {
  observer.next('Hello');
  observer.complete();
});

observable.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
```

### 70. **What are the components of Angular?**
Components in Angular consist of:
- **Selector**: Defines how the component is represented in the template.
- **Template**: Defines the HTML view.
- **Class**: Contains the logic.
- **Styles**: Define the appearance.
- **Metadata**: Provides additional information about the component.

These explanations should help you understand the various Angular concepts, their applications, and how they work together to create robust web applications.
